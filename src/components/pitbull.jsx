                        The American Pit Bull Terrier has been around for over 150 years. Originally designed to be the ultimate gladiator, the American Pit Bull Terrier was bred to be a physically active, agile, and tenacious breed of great power, athleticism, and musculature. Designed in England, Ireland, and Scotland during the nineteenth century by dog fanciers looking for a dog that exhibits the tenacity and gameness of the terrier combined with the strength of the Bulldog, the American Pit Bull Terrier is personalized with all of the qualities of a great warrior: power, courage, and tenderness with its loved ones. These qualities make the American Pit Bull Terrier a very versatile breed once sought after as a gladiator, catch dog, hunter, to drive cattle, and loyal family companion. Today the breed has evolved into the ultimate companion and competitor in many performance and conformation events. For over a century the American Pit Bull Terrier has maintained breed type true to its athletic roots and any deviation that may impair its ability to perform its traditional work, or have an effect on the health and welfare of the dog should be considered a fault; and the seriousness of this fault is measure by its degree of effect. Any Characteristics that clearly indicate impurity or crossing of other breeds is not tolerated.
